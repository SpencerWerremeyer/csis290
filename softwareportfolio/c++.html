        The following project is a collaberation between me and a few other students.
        Every year in FRC we are given a new game to play.  This year the task was the shoot
        wiffle balls and place 13 inch gears on pegs.<br><br>

        We programm in command based C++ which means that we write functions that
        are called by commands to perform taks.  Our robot has a fuel shooter that
        is mounted on a turret.  The turret is controlled independantly from the
        rest of the robot.  The turret is controlled with raspberry pi that runs
        python code to recognize the goal and track it.  It is event capable of
        maintaining a set position if the robot loses sight of the target by taking
        in the robots gyroscope.
        <br><br>
        Below is a video of our robot in a match.  We are marked with red bumpers and
        are team 1987.  The match begins at 4:00.
