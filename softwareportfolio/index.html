        School.  I have participated in FIRST robotics for the last the four years
        as a member of the Broncobots team 1987. Robotics is where I learned that
        I wanted to be a software developer where I learned the basics of C++ and programming
        in general.  This year I took over as the lead programmer of our team and
        returned for my second year as the lead of the electrical subteam.
